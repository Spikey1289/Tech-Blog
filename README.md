# Tech-Blog

## Introduction
This is the README for the Tech-Blog challenge of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains the files of a full stack website for a tech-blog, where users can create accounts, login, post blogposts, and comment on others blogposts. Users are also able to edit and delete their own blogposts from their dashboard.

## Things Learned
During this Challenge, I learned a lot about handlebars, designing and creating servers, user authorization, front-to-backend data management (and vice-versa), and a little bit of Bulma for styling my website.
